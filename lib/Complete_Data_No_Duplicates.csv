Walter Almond, the events leading to Carters death began when Agee stopped a black 1997 Honda because of complaints that ""loud music"" coming from the vehicle was bothering some residents. A license check revealed the driver was wanted on a misdemeanor charge of property damage. When Agee returned to the vehicle, he asked the car's two passengers to step outside. When Carter emerged from the backseat, Almond said, four packets of marijuana fell from his clothing. Carter then bolted and led Agee on a circular foot chase. The ensuing pursuit ended with a tussle on Rosetta Street in which Agee tried to use pepper spray to subdue Carter. During the struggle, police say Carter got hold of Agee's revolver and shot him in the right arm, fracturing a bone. When Goldie and Goins arrived, they ordered Carter to drop the weapon. Instead, Almond says, Carter kept the gun trained on Agee. Goins and Goldie then fired numerous rounds, striking Carter from his leg to his left side.

Anthony Garcia,19,male,white,,,,vista,CA,,san diego,san diego sheriff's office,,"Full disclosure:  I am an attorney for the victim.  The information below is from the police reports and witness statements.  I'd be happy to email the police reports, investigations and witness statements if Deadspin would like to review the evidence itself.

Police were called because a neighbor believed 4 teenagers were smoking pot in an apartment complex's laundry room.  The sheriff's office responded to the call because it was in the unincorporated part of Vista, California.  A 25 year old female, alone, approached the four people.  There was no signs of pot.  Nevertheless, Deputy Storms decided to do a warrant check.  She handcuffed one of the individuals and sat him down on the curb outside the laundry room.  She went to handcuff the victim, who asked why he was being arrested.  She told him to shut up or she would tase him.  He then looked over his shoulder at her and she told him to turn around or she was going to tase him.  She then bear hugged him.  The victim (5'7"" 190lbs  (arrest records indicate 5'8"" 220lbs, of course)), then tried to get away believing he was about to be tased.  He pushed the officer out of the laundry room.  She still had him in the bear hug position as if she was about to suplex him.  The two fell to the ground, Deputy Storms falling on her back.  Witnesses state that the victim never once tried to strike Deputy Storms and was struggling to try to get away.  Deputy Storms discharged her taser during the fracas on the ground and the probes missed the victim but nearly hit the bystanders.  The victim got to his feet and began to run.  While he was at least 30 feet away, Deputy Storms shot him in the back.  The bullet entered about 4"" to the right of the spine, severed the victim's lung, liver and spleen and ultimately came to rest immediately behind his right nipple.  The victim spent weeks in the hospital recovering.

The following day, Deputy Storms said that she looked up from the sidewalk and saw the victim with her taser and believed he was about to shoot her.  The taser was on the ground about 40 feet from the victim at the time he was shot IN THE BACK, something that the journalists and officers doing the investigation fail to address in their coverage.

Misdemeanor warrants for possession of marijuana and no valid driver's license had been issued for Eye by Dallas County. Eye also was suspected of stealing a 2000 Kia on November 11, 2011.

Eye refused to stop for the officer and a pursuit ensued, which went from Texas County into Dent County on Missouri Route 32. During that pursuit, Eye caused his vehicle to strike the front of the trooper's cruiser, disabling the patrol vehicle. Eye continued and was not located that night.

At approximately noon, November 20, 2011, information was developed indicating that Eye was possibly on or near a county road, north of Interstate 44, in western Pulaski County.

Approximately 30 minutes later, troopers located a stolen Chevrolet pickup, occupied by a white male, which they believed to be Eye, backed into a wooded area off Randolph Road, approximately one mile west of Missouri Route 7.

When troopers ordered the suspect to show his hands he refused to comply. He then accelerated and steered his vehicle toward the officers. In response, the troopers fired at the suspect with their Patrol issued rifles. The suspect then drove west on Randolph Road, while being pursued by officers, until the vehicle traveled off the left side of the road and stopped.

At that time, the trooper observed the suspect moving around in his vehicle and brandishing a firearm.

One of the city police officers, Raul Gonzalez, was firing into the trunk, fearing for his life, Mastroianni said.

Hassan Ibrahim Bazzi,39,male,,,,,dearborn,MI,,,dearborn police department,,"Police said that Bazzi was pulled over for failing to yield to a fire truck. He was also allegedly driving at high rates of speed and disregarding traffic control devices. Bazzi allegedly drove toward the Dearborn officer who pulled him over and attempted to strike him with his car according to police, which led to the officer firing five shots at Bazzi's car. 
Witnesses at the scene also confirmed they heard five shots that sounded like pistol fire. 
Bazzi was not hit by the shots and continued driving and crashed into another vehicle shortly afterward, ending up in front of the ACCESS sign where clothes and several other items were strewn all over the middle of Schaefer Road. 
After the crash, Bazzi attempted to flee and was captured by officers. Both Bazzi and the arresting officer suffered minor injuries according to Dearborn Police and were treated at a local hospital. According to Majed Moughni, a Dearborn-based attorney who has agreed to take on Bazzi's case pro bono, Bazzi was suffering from schizophrenia at the time and was not taking his medication, which may have caused him to have a fearful, irrational reaction.
Moughni also said that the shots were aimed at the backseat of Bazzi's car. The debris scattered all over the road was likely from his car, which he had been living out of according to Moughni. Bazzi had originally offered to pay Moughni with food stamps to defend him. 
Moughni also said that a witness told him that Bazzi was ""beaten up pretty well"" by police after he attempted to flee. 
No matter what happens in the meantime, the likely final outcome is that Bazzi, a Lebanese immigrant, is deported, said Moughni. With Bazzi's previous felony conviction and a laundry list of new felonies pending against him, immigration authori-ties have issued a prisoner hold, meaning that even if he posts the $300,000 bond for this case, he will remain in custody to be dealt with by U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. Bazzi, 39, immigrated in 1991 and is a legal resident, Moughni said.

Asked what is his goal for his client in this case, Moughni said, “to have him deported as soon as possible so that taxpayers don't have to pay unnecessary costs.”

A passing stranger helped them change the tire, but the spare was also flat, so the man led them to a filling station. But the tire would not inflate, and so Ms. Miller waited in the car while the man drove her friend home to get assistance from the family. When relatives arrived they found Ms. Miller apparently comatose in the locked car, with the engine running and the radio on. She was shaking bodily and foaming at the mouth, and had a .380 semi-automatic pistol in her lap.[2][3] Unable to wake her they called 9-1-1. Four Police officers arrived at the scene within minutes and, informed by family members of the presence of a gun in the car, approached the vehicle with guns drawn.[3] After attempting for several minutes to get a response from Miller, the decision was made to force entry into the vehicle as Miller was in apparent need of immediate medical attention.[3] As one of the officers was attempting to remove the gun, Miller is said to have sat up and grabbed the weapon at which point the officers opened fire 23 times, hitting Ms. Miller with at least 12 bullets, including four in the head. The officers involved, three white and one Hispanic, were placed on administrative leave. They claimed they had acted in self-defense.

The releasing of the coroner's report prompted protests from the community, who rallied at the police headquarters, demanding an independent investigation, amongst suggestions that institutional racism had played a role.The officers involved were fired from Riverside Police Department but did not face prosecution due to ""insufficient evidence.""

Chase Houston,28,male,white,,,,spanaway,WA,,pierce,pierce county metro swat team,,"On Dec. 3, 2013, at 2:00 p.m., Pierce County Sheriff's deputies attempted to perform a welfare check on Houston at a garage-style storage unit near 216th Street and State Route 7 in Spanaway. Houston's family told the deputies that Houston was living in the storage unit, was making irrational comments over the phone and on social networks, and was high on methamphetamine and armed. Deputies called Houston, and Houston said he would kill them and anyone else who tried to contact him.

The SWAT team was called in and a negotiator was able to talk Houston into coming out of the unit. Houston partially opened the garage door, but refused to cooperate with the SWAT team's commands to put his hands on his head and turn around. SWAT members fired non-lethal projectiles at Houston in an attempt to subdue him, but the projectiles had no effect on Houston. He went back inside the unit and closed the door.

To prevent Houston from using his car that was parked in front of the door, SWAT members attempted to tow it away. As the team was hooking a cable to the vehicle, Houston began firing a gun through the garage door. One SWAT member was struck in the arm. Two other team members returned gunfire through the door with their rifles. The gunfire inside the storage unit stopped.

Team members attempted to contact Houston, but were unsuccessful. They entered the storage unit and found Houston deceased on the floor with a handgun and expended casings next to him.

According to Medical Examiner Dr. Thomas Clark, Houston died from a gunshot wound to his abdomen. Dr. Clark also determined Houston had methamphetamines, marijuana and oxycodone in his system at the time of his death.

Police issued warrants, claiming that his wife had injuries consistent with aggravated assault with a firearm.  (She disputes this and states they had only been arguing loudly.)  At some point in the long standoff with police, a SWAT team was called.  Once police secured warrants, they entered the apartment and shots were fired by police.  Marcus Bell was killed.

Craig Lane Petersen,52,male,,,,,san diego,CA,,san diego,san diego county sheriff's department,,"Homicide investigators on Thursday said a Borrego Springs murder suspect who was shot and killed by a sheriff's sergeant Wednesday had grabbed a nail gun from his pickup bed.

Investigators also identified sheriff's Sgt. Manuel Diaz, a 20-year department veteran, as the lawman who shot and killed Craig Petersen, 52, a general contractor suspected of fatally stabbing a 71-year-old Borrego Springs resident.

Sheriff's homicide unit Sgt. Roy Frank released new details on the case Thursday, saying Petersen went to the home of George Mendenhall, on Borrego Hills Road, about 6:30 or 6:45 a.m. Wednesday “regarding some tools.”

After Petersen left, a female member of Mendenhall's family found Mendenhall in the garage, bleeding, about 7 a.m. He had been stabbed several times in the chest, and died a short time later, Frank said.

“The motive is still under investigation,” Frank said. “We are finalizing interviews to try to find out what the motive was.”

At least one witness provided deputies with information that Petersen was the suspect in the slaying. Deputies then launched a manhunt for him across the small desert community.

Petersen lived in a Borrego Springs trailer park and had known Mendenhall for about 10 years, Frank said.

About 1 p.m., Diaz was on patrol in the area of Japatul Valley and Descanso when he saw a light blue Ford F150 pickup in the Park and Ride lot at Interstate 8 and state Route 79. A man was in the cargo bed. Frank said that as Diaz approached, the man, subsequently identified as Petersen, grabbed a nail gun.

Frank said Diaz saw the man reach for something that looked like a weapon, and fired. Petersen fell in the truck bed.",,http://www.sdcda.org/office/officer-involved-shootings.html,,,false,U.S. Police Shootings,"San Diego, CA, USA",32.715738,-117.1610838

Thomas Read,36,male,white,,,,phillipsburg,NJ,,warren,phillipsburg police department,,"Although a man with a knife, making threats towards police officers seems justifiable (per se) the amount of time the officers spent at the scene is alarming.  According to the reports, the police were called to the scene ""just before 9:30"" and another report from a first responder at 9:46 describes a man with multiple gunshot wounds. The investigation is ongoing with ""no timetable"" for completion.  The man may have attacked the officers once they entered the house making the death justifiable, but in my mind, it seems the police were a bit to willing to go into the home and confront the armed man (all purely speculative on my part).  It has been reported that he lived alone and I couldn't find any mention of the police finding anyone else in the home.  No hostage, which seems to lend to the general thought that the police had no reason to enter the home without trying a little harder to get the man to surrender peacefully.  My opinion, of course.

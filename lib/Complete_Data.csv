Because of alcohol withdrawal symptoms he was booked into Spokane County Jail 2West, a medical unit. He was ""speaking in a different language"" and resisted when guards tried to move him to a monitored cell. He was tasered, hit and carried there by Sgt. Steve Long and Deputy Ted Tosfrud. He resisted a medical check and was hit and kneed by Sgt. Long, and Officer Tim Christopherson, and ""donkey kicked"" by Deputy John Elam while putting him under a cell bunk. The guards returned to place Sichiro in a restraint chair and he was immediately tasered by Deputy Todd Belitz. Tosfrud tasered him several times as they placed him in the chair. Sichiro lost consciousness and died at Deaconess Medical Center of a lacerated liver. An inmate stated that he did not hear the guards give Sichiro verbal commands before tasering him, and that although Sichiro did not speak much English he told the guards in English that he was dying, but they kept telling him to stand up. Elam's donkey kick was ruled the cause of death, and a homicide; he became a police officer several weeks later and was fired the first day on the job after lying about a car crash.

A license check revealed the driver was wanted on a misdemeanor charge of property damage. When Agee returned to the vehicle, he asked the car's two passengers to step outside. When Carter emerged from the backseat, Almond said, four packets of marijuana fell from his clothing. Carter then bolted and led Agee on a circular foot chase. The ensuing pursuit ended with a tussle on Rosetta Street in which Agee tried to use pepper spray to subdue Carter. During the struggle, police say Carter got hold of Agee's revolver and shot him in the right arm, fracturing a bone. When Goldie and Goins arrived, they ordered Carter to drop the weapon. Instead, Almond says, Carter kept the gun trained on Agee. Goins and Goldie then fired numerous rounds, striking Carter from his leg to his left side.

The incident occurred just after 3:45 p.m. near the intersection of East Harbor Boulevard and Figueroa Boulevard (map), where an officer was struck by a GMC Sonoma pickup truck, a spokesman for the Ventura Police Department said.

The driver of the truck was stopped by traffic officers, and as they were talking to him, he allegedly put the vehicle in reverse gear and smashed into a truck behind him, Wilson said.

“He put the truck back in drive, drove forward, striking one of our officers,” Wilson said. “That officer landed up on the hood of the [Sonoma] and into the windshield.”

Anthony Garcia,19,Male,White,,,,Vista,CA - California,,San Diego,San Diego Sheriff's Office,,"Full disclosure:  I am an attorney for the victim.  The information below is from the police reports and witness statements.  I'd be happy to email the police reports, investigations and witness statements if Deadspin would like to review the evidence itself.

Police were called because a neighbor believed 4 teenagers were smoking pot in an apartment complex's laundry room.  The sheriff's office responded to the call because it was in the unincorporated part of Vista, California.  A 25 year old female, alone, approached the four people.  There was no signs of pot.  Nevertheless, Deputy Storms decided to do a warrant check.  She handcuffed one of the individuals and sat him down on the curb outside the laundry room.  She went to handcuff the victim, who asked why he was being arrested.  She told him to shut up or she would tase him.  He then looked over his shoulder at her and she told him to turn around or she was going to tase him.  She then bear hugged him.  The victim (5'7"" 190lbs  (arrest records indicate 5'8"" 220lbs, of course)), then tried to get away believing he was about to be tased.  He pushed the officer out of the laundry room.  She still had him in the bear hug position as if she was about to suplex him.  The two fell to the ground, Deputy Storms falling on her back.  Witnesses state that the victim never once tried to strike Deputy Storms and was struggling to try to get away.  Deputy Storms discharged her taser during the fracas on the ground and the probes missed the victim but nearly hit the bystanders.  The victim got to his feet and began to run.  While he was at least 30 feet away, Deputy Storms shot him in the back.  The bullet entered about 4"" to the right of the spine, severed the victim's lung, liver and spleen and ultimately came to rest immediately behind his right nipple.  The victim spent weeks in the hospital recovering.

The following day, Deputy Storms said that she looked up from the sidewalk and saw the victim with her taser and believed he was about to shoot her.  The taser was on the ground about 40 feet from the victim at the time he was shot IN THE BACK, something that the journalists and officers doing the investigation fail to address in their coverage.

Daryl Eye,49,Male,Unknown,,,,Licking,MO - Missouri,,Texas County,Missouri Highway Patrol,,"Felony warrants for tampering, first degree and resisting arrest had been issued for Eye by Laclede County.

Misdemeanor warrants for possession of marijuana and no valid driver's license had been issued for Eye by Dallas County. Eye also was suspected of stealing a 2000 Kia on November 11, 2011.

Eye refused to stop for the officer and a pursuit ensued, which went from Texas County into Dent County on Missouri Route 32. During that pursuit, Eye caused his vehicle to strike the front of the trooper's cruiser, disabling the patrol vehicle. Eye continued and was not located that night.

At approximately noon, November 20, 2011, information was developed indicating that Eye was possibly on or near a county road, north of Interstate 44, in western Pulaski County.

Approximately 30 minutes later, troopers located a stolen Chevrolet pickup, occupied by a white male, which they believed to be Eye, backed into a wooded area off Randolph Road, approximately one mile west of Missouri Route 7.

When troopers ordered the suspect to show his hands he refused to comply. He then accelerated and steered his vehicle toward the officers. In response, the troopers fired at the suspect with their Patrol issued rifles.

The fight with Mylo wound up on the ground. The teen initially was on his stomach but managed to roll onto his back. One officer entwined Mylo's legs with his own, a wrestling move known as a reverse grapevine.

The officer grabbed the back of Mylo's head. He pulled down hard, forcing Mylo's chin tight against the teen's own chest. That made it difficult for Mylo to open his mouth and reduced the officers' risk of being bitten by him. They remained in that position while the other officers tried to pin Mylo's arms.

The teen still was talking. Then, officers reported, he suddenly slipped into unconsciousness. Handcuffs were snapped around his wrists. Officers bound his feet with nylon straps. When his family read the reports later, it bothered them that one of the restraints used was the leash a police dog handler had been carrying in her uniform pocket.

Mylo was placed on a paramedic's backboard and strapped down. The officers told the aid crew waiting nearby that Mylo, though unconscious, had a pulse and was still breathing.

The paramedics moved in and quickly realized that wasn't so. They got Mylo's heart pumping and restored his breathing.

An ambulance raced him to the hospital, where doctors determined his brain had died. There was nothing doctors could do.

Hassan Ibrahim Bazzi,39,Male,Unknown,,,,Dearborn,MI - Michigan,,,Dearborn Police Department,,"Police said that Bazzi was pulled over for failing to yield to a fire truck. He was also allegedly driving at high rates of speed and disregarding traffic control devices. Bazzi allegedly drove toward the Dearborn officer who pulled him over and attempted to strike him with his car according to police, which led to the officer firing five shots at Bazzi's car. 
Witnesses at the scene also confirmed they heard five shots that sounded like pistol fire. 
Bazzi was not hit by the shots and continued driving and crashed into another vehicle shortly afterward, ending up in front of the ACCESS sign where clothes and several other items were strewn all over the middle of Schaefer Road. 
After the crash, Bazzi attempted to flee and was captured by officers. Both Bazzi and the arresting officer suffered minor injuries according to Dearborn Police and were treated at a local hospital. According to Majed Moughni, a Dearborn-based attorney who has agreed to take on Bazzi's case pro bono, Bazzi was suffering from schizophrenia at the time and was not taking his medication, which may have caused him to have a fearful, irrational reaction.
Moughni also said that the shots were aimed at the backseat of Bazzi's car. The debris scattered all over the road was likely from his car, which he had been living out of according to Moughni. Bazzi had originally offered to pay Moughni with food stamps to defend him. 
Moughni also said that a witness told him that Bazzi was ""beaten up pretty well"" by police after he attempted to flee. 
No matter what happens in the meantime, the likely final outcome is that Bazzi, a Lebanese immigrant, is deported, said Moughni. With Bazzi’s previous felony conviction and a laundry list of new felonies pending against him, immigration authori-ties have issued a prisoner hold, meaning that even if he posts the $300,000 bond for this case, he will remain in custody to be dealt with by U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. Bazzi, 39, immigrated in 1991 and is a legal resident, Moughni said.

Asked what is his goal for his client in this case, Moughni said, “to have him deported as soon as possible so that taxpayers don’t have to pay unnecessary costs.”

A passing stranger helped them change the tire, but the spare was also flat, so the man led them to a filling station. But the tire would not inflate, and so Ms. Miller waited in the car while the man drove her friend home to get assistance from the family. When relatives arrived they found Ms. Miller apparently comatose in the locked car, with the engine running and the radio on. She was shaking bodily and foaming at the mouth, and had a .380 semi-automatic pistol in her lap.[2][3] Unable to wake her they called 9-1-1. Four Police officers arrived at the scene within minutes and, informed by family members of the presence of a gun in the car, approached the vehicle with guns drawn.[3] After attempting for several minutes to get a response from Miller, the decision was made to force entry into the vehicle as Miller was in apparent need of immediate medical attention.[3] As one of the officers was attempting to remove the gun, Miller is said to have sat up and grabbed the weapon at which point the officers opened fire 23 times, hitting Ms. Miller with at least 12 bullets, including four in the head. The officers involved, three white and one Hispanic, were placed on administrative leave. They claimed they had acted in self-defense.

The releasing of the coroner's report prompted protests from the community, who rallied at the police headquarters, demanding an independent investigation, amongst suggestions that institutional racism had played a role.The officers involved were fired from Riverside Police Department but did not face prosecution due to ""insufficient evidence.""

Marquise Jones,23,Male,Black or African American,,,,San Antonio,TX - Texas,,Bexar,Off-Duty SAPD (San Antonio Police Department),,"SAN ANTONIO — A driver in a crash that led to an officer-involved shooting last week at a drive through refused to turn off his car when ordered to and was arrested on outstanding municipal court warrants, according to a police report released Wednesday.

Fabian Garza, 21, was driving a 1994 Cadillac El Dorado that rear-ended a white SUV early Friday in the drive-through of Chacho's, in the 8600 block of Perrin Beitel Road on the Northeast Side.

Garza tried to back up and leave the scene of the 1 a.m. wreck, according to police. The SUV's driver, whose identity is unknown, “exchanged words” with the people in the Cadillac and left the scene, according to police.

A witness told Officer Robert Encina of the San Antonio Police Department about the incident and added . Encina was in full uniform working an off-duty security job at the restaurant, of the incident, adding that the people in the Cadillac seemed intoxicated.

The witness said the officer repeatedly asked Garza to turn off the car and step outside the car. Garza and his passenger Marquise Jones, 23, were not following Encina's orders and Jones seemed to be reaching for something in the car, the witness told police.

Encina was able to turn off the car himself, and put the keys on the roof while trying to handcuff Garza, according to police.

At that point, police said Jones got out of the passenger door and pulled a revolver from the area of his waist, turning to look at Encina.

The witness said Encina then fired shots.

Jones started to run westward before collapsing, according to the police report.

An arriving officer found Jones lying face down toward Perrin Beitel road with a gunshot wound on the left side of his back. He was not breathing and was pronounced dead within minutes, according to police.

Sheriff's officials stressed that it was ""a federal officer"" and not them who fired, so the case was turned over to the FBI.

Chase Houston,28,Male,White,,,,Spanaway,WA - Washington,,Pierce,Pierce County METRO SWAT Team,,"On Dec. 3, 2013, at 2:00 p.m., Pierce County Sheriff’s deputies attempted to perform a welfare check on Houston at a garage-style storage unit near 216th Street and State Route 7 in Spanaway. Houston’s family told the deputies that Houston was living in the storage unit, was making irrational comments over the phone and on social networks, and was high on methamphetamine and armed. Deputies called Houston, and Houston said he would kill them and anyone else who tried to contact him.

The SWAT team was called in and a negotiator was able to talk Houston into coming out of the unit. Houston partially opened the garage door, but refused to cooperate with the SWAT team’s commands to put his hands on his head and turn around. SWAT members fired non-lethal projectiles at Houston in an attempt to subdue him, but the projectiles had no effect on Houston. He went back inside the unit and closed the door.

To prevent Houston from using his car that was parked in front of the door, SWAT members attempted to tow it away. As the team was hooking a cable to the vehicle, Houston began firing a gun through the garage door. One SWAT member was struck in the arm. Two other team members returned gunfire through the door with their rifles. The gunfire inside the storage unit stopped.

Team members attempted to contact Houston, but were unsuccessful. They entered the storage unit and found Houston deceased on the floor with a handgun and expended casings next to him.

According to Medical Examiner Dr. Thomas Clark, Houston died from a gunshot wound to his abdomen. Dr. Clark also determined Houston had methamphetamines, marijuana and oxycodone in his system at the time of his death.

Rodney Oneil Pike,38,Male,White,,,,Buford,GA - Georgia,,Gwinnett,Gwinnett County Police Department,,"Pike's mother called the police because he was on drugs and was not reasonable. She warned the police that he might run and said “Don’t shoot him, please don’t hurt my baby” to the dispatcher. Pike had active warrants and had evaded police before.

When police showed up, Pike got in his car and backed out of the driveway. Police contend that he hit an officer, and two officers drew guns and began firing to prevent him hitting another officer. Pike's family contend that this was unnecessary and an escalation of force. Police respond that they first used a taser, but to no effect. The officer Pike hit was treated and released from a hospital. The two officers involved in the shooting were placed on administrative leave with pay during an investigation.

This is the third shooting by GCPD within the month. Other recent GCPD shootings happened April 10th and 22nd

Notes on accuracy for other people to fix:
1. Total number of shots fired is unknown. The number 6 is a baseless assumption that each of the two officers fired 3 shots, and is just a placeholder due to this form only accepting numbers greater than zero for shots fired. 
2. It is listed as unknown if the victim was armed.

Craig Lane Petersen,52,Male,Unknown,,,,San Diego,CA - California,,San Diego,San Diego County Sheriff's Department,,"Homicide investigators on Thursday said a Borrego Springs murder suspect who was shot and killed by a sheriff’s sergeant Wednesday had grabbed a nail gun from his pickup bed.

Investigators also identified sheriff’s Sgt. Manuel Diaz, a 20-year department veteran, as the lawman who shot and killed Craig Petersen, 52, a general contractor suspected of fatally stabbing a 71-year-old Borrego Springs resident.

Sheriff’s homicide unit Sgt. Roy Frank released new details on the case Thursday, saying Petersen went to the home of George Mendenhall, on Borrego Hills Road, about 6:30 or 6:45 a.m. Wednesday “regarding some tools.”

After Petersen left, a female member of Mendenhall’s family found Mendenhall in the garage, bleeding, about 7 a.m. He had been stabbed several times in the chest, and died a short time later, Frank said.

“The motive is still under investigation,” Frank said. “We are finalizing interviews to try to find out what the motive was.”

At least one witness provided deputies with information that Petersen was the suspect in the slaying. Deputies then launched a manhunt for him across the small desert community.

Petersen lived in a Borrego Springs trailer park and had known Mendenhall for about 10 years, Frank said.

According to police Negron placed Lloyd in headlock, Lloyd tried to pistol whip Negron and accidentally dropped the gun, at which point Negron picked up the gun and allegedly pointed it at Reynolds, and a shootout ensued in which each fired nine times, with Negron hit twice.  

Witness statement: ""The dude picked up the gun because he was scared,"" Vidal said. ""He didn't deserve to get shot.""

Negron freed without bail on August 1, 2014 because DA apparently waited too long to present the case.

Statement from Negron's lawyer: ""Negron’s lawyer, Paul Hirsch, yesterday insisted to The Post, “My client was afraid and acted in self-defense during what he thought was a threat from a regular person, certainly not a police officer.”",,http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/man-shot-off-duty-brawl-brooklyn-old-gallery-bar-apparent-fight-woman-article-1.160828,,9,Armed,U.S. Police Shootings,"Brooklyn, NY, USA",40.6781784,-73.9441579

Rafael Alonso Olivas,23,Male,Unknown,,,,Las Vegas Valley,NV - Nevada,,Clark County,Metro Police,,"Three Metro Police officers fatally shot a 23-year-old man wielding a butcher knife Thursday morning in a western Las Vegas Valley neighborhood.

Police responded at 6:46 a.m. to the report of a domestic disturbance on Musical Lane near the intersection of Firestone Drive and Westcliff Drive. That location is southwest of the Buffalo Drive and Summerlin Parkway interchange.

Metro Police Capt. Patrick Neville said a woman reported she was having an argument with her son and that he was out of control.

Police arrived and found a man with a butcher knife walking southbound on Firestone Drive. Neville said the man approached officers after authorities made several commands for him to stop.

The officers then discharged non-lethal rounds at the man, striking him four times, in an attempt to get him to stop, but the man continued toward officers with the knife, Neville said.

""Officers feared for their lives,"" he said.

The three officers then fired multiple shots at the man, who was pronounced dead at University Medical Center. Neville said he didn't know how close the officers were to the man when they opened fire.

Victor Chavez, the man's cousin, identified the man who was killed as Rafael Olivas.

Chavez, 21, described his cousin’s relationship with his mother as fairly typical, with arguments only once in a while.

“I still can’t believe it,” he said. “It hasn’t set in.”

Chavez said one of the last times he saw Olivas — known as “Ralfy” to relatives — was during a party for a younger family member. Olivas lived with his mother and has several siblings, he said.

Police said the mother wasn't injured during the argument with her son. It wasn’t immediately clear whether other family members were home at the time or what led to the argument.

“All I heard was he had a knife,” said Chavez, who rushed to join family at the scene after the shooting. “That’s no reason to be shot four times.”

The three officers involved were placed on paid administrative leave, which is standard procedure for officer-involved shootings. Their names will be released in 48 hours.
